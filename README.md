# Connect4
Creating Connect4 gameplay out of multiple languages, both from the server and client perspectives.

## Rust: Compile + Run
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into a directory with a `Cargo.toml` file.
2. In that terminal, run `cargo run`.

## C: Compile + Run
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into a directory with a `GNUMakeFile`.
2. In that terminal, run `make clean`. This ensures we clean out old binaries.
3. In that terminal, run `make`.
4. In that terminal, run the new executable that was just produced (something like `./<executable_name>`). Ex: `./server_c`.

## Python: Run
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into a directory with the desired Python file.
2. In a terminal, run `python3 <file_name>`. 
2. Alternatively, if you're using VS Code, you can click the "play" arrow in the top right.
